# Routine Detector - Detection

The project refers to the community detection part of the Routine Detector approach.

## Requirements
The environment require Python `3.10.x`.

Tested on Apple M2 - mac OS 14.x

Before running the code, install the dependencies with:

```
pip install cdlib
pip install pm4py
```

## Usage

Refer to the notebooks for the detection execution reported below. In particular two notebooks are provided and both refer to the challenge proposed during the International Workshop on BP-Meet-IoT (see e.g., https://bp-meet-iot.webs.upv.es/2022). The challenge is described in [1]. 

* `algorithms_analysis.ipynb` analyzes the dataset proposed in the 2022 edition.
* `algorithms_analysis_2020.ipynb` analyzes the dataset proposed in the 2020 edition.
